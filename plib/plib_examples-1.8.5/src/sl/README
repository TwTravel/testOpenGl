example -- Plays a variety of sounds read from samples on disk plus
           it generates a sound in-situ in memory.  A good general
           sound sample replay example.

playsound -- Plays any sound sample file that you enter on it's
           command line.  Much simpler than 'example'.

mod_demo -- Plays a '.mod' music file.
