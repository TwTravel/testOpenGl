SSG Example programs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tux  -- Loads a 3D Tux model and a simple scene and
        animates it until you hit key.
        Needs to be run from it's source directory
        so it can find it's data files.

Majik -- An example I wrote for the Majik team
        http://majik.netti.fi to show them how to
        make a viewer for large area terrain.
        It's pretty basic.

Water -- A demo of some ssgAux stuff - waves, particle-systems
        a teapot and a cube.

Sky   -- A demo of a sky dome, with sun, moon, stars and clouds.

Dynamics -- Spring/Mass/Damper demo.
