SkyDome.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PLIB ssgAux library contains a class for creating a sky dome.

   class ssgaSky ;

The program in this directory demonstrates creating a sky dome,
including the sun, moon, stars and clouds.

This program does not attempt to place celestial bodies accurately
if you wish to place sun, moon, planets & stars correctly then you
could possibly plug-in the SimGear Ephemeris code.
