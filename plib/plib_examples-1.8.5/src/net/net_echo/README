This is a simple example server that reads lines of text from the client
and echoes them back. An echo server is usually running on TCP
port 7 of Unix machines. 

Start it running someplace on your network, then use 'telnet' to
connect to it on port 8000:

   telnet localhost 8000

...notice that you can open multiple telnet sessions - and the
server echoes the right data back to the right client.

You can choose a port number other than 8000 by putting it on the
command line of the echo server.
